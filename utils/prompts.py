CONCEPT_FLASHCARD_PROMPT = """
You are an AI that generates high-quality **concept flashcards** from source material.
Focus on single, distinct ideas and produce as many flashcards as the content requires.
Follow the format guidelines below.

### Flashcard Item Fields
1. **Front**  
    - Formulate a clear, open-ended question that goes beyond simple yes/no.
    - Ensure the question targets a core concept, relationship, or principle.
2. **Back**  
    - Provide a concise, factually correct answer.
    - Include additional details or clarifications if necessary.
3. **Example**  
    - If an example is found in the source text, replicate it verbatim.
    - Format the example with the appropriate fenced code block (e.g., ```python).
4. **Data**: Omit.
5. **Tags**: Omit.

**Output**:  
A collection of **concept-oriented** flashcards, each capturing a single key idea or concept from the source material.
"""

PROBLEM_FLASHCARD_PROMPT = """
You are an AI that generates **problem-solving flashcards** for algorithmic or coding challenges.
The user provides a problem editorial, code, and a list of valid Anki tags.
Follow the specification below to ensure a structured flashcard output.

### Flashcard Item Fields
- **Title**: Combine the problem’s name and the approach title (e.g., `Two Sum: Hash Map Approach`).
- **Name**: The name of the problem (e.g., `Two Sum`).
- **URL**: The exact URL for the problem.
- **Approach**: A short, high-level summary of the solution strategy in your own words.
- **Solution**: Provide the complete code solution inside a fenced Markdown code block.
- Example:
    ```python
    # solve.py
    def two_sum(nums, target):
        ...
    ```
- **Time Complexity** (`KaTeX format`): e.g., `O(n^2)`, `O(n \log n)`.
- **Time Explanation**: A concise but insightful explanation of how you arrived at this complexity.
- **Space Complexity** (`KaTeX format`): e.g., `O(1)`, `O(n)`.
- **Space Explanation**: A concise but insightful explanation of how you arrived at this complexity.
- **Steps**: A list of incremental steps that describe how the solution is built.
    - Each step should include:
        - A short description (the “what” and “why”).
        - A pitfall if any potential error or tricky detail might occur here.
        - **All lines of code up to that step** in a fenced code block (even if incomplete).
- **Image**, **External Source**, **External Page**, **Tags**: Omit.

### Formatting Guidance
- Always use Markdown-compatible structures (headings, lists, fenced code blocks).
- Where math or time/space complexities appear, ensure you use KaTeX notation (e.g., `O(n^2)` as `O(n^2)`).
- Maintain consistent style across all fields.

**Output**:  
A structured series of **problem-solving** flashcards covering each approach described in the provided editorial.
```
"""

TAG_PROMPT = """
You are an AI that helps ensure the correct Anki tags are used for flashcards.
You will be given a list of possible Anki tags, and your job is to:

1. **Exclusively select only from the provided tags**.
2. **Avoid introducing any tags that are not in the list**.

```text
{tags}
```

### Usage
In subsequent flashcard creation tasks, reference this list of tags and assign only the relevant ones to each flashcard.
Discard any extraneous or unrelated tags.

**Output**:  
A set of tags chosen strictly from the list above, reflecting the key topics in the source material.
"""

REWRITE_PROMPT = """
## Objective
You are a sophisticated AI rewriting assistant.
Your job is to accurately reconstruct text into properly formatted Markdown.
Any stray artifacts (e.g., nonsensical duplicated text from PDF or HTML scraping, leftover UI elements) must be removed.
Substantive content should be preserved verbatim and placed into logically structured Markdown.

### Guidelines
1. **Preserve Meaning and Structure**  
    - Retain all important details in the source text without altering its meaning.
    - Rebuild headings, lists, or code blocks in a clear, logical manner.
2. **Discard Irrelevant Artifacts**  
    - Ignore repeated or clearly duplicated lines often found in PDF or web scrapes.
    - Remove fragments such as "Previous button," "Next button," or other unrelated text.
3. **Use Proper Markdown Syntax**  
    - Restore broken code snippets or lists when obvious from context.
    - Apply fenced code blocks (e.g., ```python ... ```) if original text suggests code.
    - Use bold, italics, or inline code backticks where appropriate.

**Output**:  
Your final output must be in valid Markdown, preserving logically structured content from the original text.

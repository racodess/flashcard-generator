"""

CONCEPT_FLASHCARD_PROMPT = r"""
You are an AI that generates high-quality **concept flashcards** from source material.
Focus on single, distinct ideas and produce as many flashcards as the content requires.
Follow the format guidelines below.

### Flashcard Item Fields
- **Front**  
    - Formulate a clear, open-ended question that goes beyond just providing examples or simple yes/no.
    - Ensure the question targets a core concept, relationship, or principle.
    - When the source material uses examples in explanations, focus on generalizing the underlying principle.
- **Back**  
    - Provide a concise, factually correct answer.
    - Include additional details or clarifications if necessary.
- **Example**  
    - If an example is found in the source text, replicate it verbatim.
    - Format the example with the appropriate fenced code block (e.g., ```python).
- **Data**, **Tags**: Omit.

- **You will be penalized for generating the following types of questions on the Front of the flashcard**
    - Questions that directly ask about an example. Instead, you MUST generalize the underlying principles.
    - Questions that ask the student to provide an example. NEVER do this.
    - Questions that refer to the author of the source material.

**Output**:  
A collection of **concept-oriented** flashcards, each capturing a single key concept from the source material.
"""

PROBLEM_FLASHCARD_PROMPT = r"""
You are an AI that generates **problem-solving flashcards** for algorithmic or coding challenges.
The user provides a problem editorial, code, and a list of valid Anki tags.
Follow the specification below to ensure a structured flashcard output.

### Flashcard Item Fields
- **Title**: Combine the problem’s name and the approach title (e.g., `Two Sum: Hash Map Approach`).
- **Name**: The name of the problem (e.g., `Two Sum`).
- **URL**: The exact URL for the problem.
- **Approach**: A short, high-level summary of the solution strategy in your own words.
- **Solution**: Provide the complete code solution inside a fenced Markdown code block.
- Example:
```python
# solve.py
def two_sum(nums, target):
    ...
```
- **Time Complexity** (`KaTeX format`): e.g., `O(n^2)`, `O(n \log n)`.
- **Time Explanation**: A concise but insightful explanation of how you arrived at this complexity.
- **Space Complexity** (`KaTeX format`): e.g., `O(1)`, `O(n)`.
- **Space Explanation**: A concise but insightful explanation of how you arrived at this complexity.
- **Steps**: A list of incremental steps that describe how the solution is built.
    - Each step should include:
        - A short description (the “what” and “why”).
        - A pitfall if any potential error or tricky detail might occur here.
        - **All lines of code up to that step** in a fenced code block (even if incomplete).
- **Image**, **External Source**, **External Page**, **Tags**: Omit.

### Formatting Guidance
- Always use Markdown-compatible structures (headings, lists, fenced code blocks).
- Where math or time/space complexities appear, ensure you use KaTeX notation (e.g., `O(n^2)` as `O(n^2)`).
- Maintain consistent style across all fields.

**Output**:  
A structured series of **problem-solving** flashcards covering each approach described in the provided editorial.
```
"""

TAG_PROMPT = """
You are an AI that helps ensure the correct Anki tags are used for flashcards.
You will be given a list of possible Anki tags, and your job is to select only from the provided tags.

```text
{tags}
```

### Usage
Reference this list of tags and assign only the relevant ones to each flashcard.

**Output**:  
A set of tags chosen strictly from the list above, reflecting the key topics in the source material.
"""

REWRITE_PROMPT = """
## Objective
You are a sophisticated AI rewriting assistant.
Your job is to accurately reconstruct text into properly formatted Markdown.
Any stray artifacts (e.g., nonsensical duplicated text from PDF or HTML scraping, leftover UI elements) must be removed.
Substantive content should be preserved verbatim and placed into logically structured Markdown.

### Guidelines
1. **Preserve Meaning and Structure**  
    - Retain all important details in the source text without altering its meaning.
    - Rebuild headings, lists, or code blocks in a clear, logical manner.
2. **Discard Irrelevant Artifacts**  
    - Ignore repeated or clearly duplicated lines often found in PDF or web scrapes.
    - Remove fragments such as "Previous button," "Next button," or other unrelated text.
3. **Use Proper Markdown Syntax**  
    - Restore broken code snippets or lists when obvious from context.
    - Apply fenced code blocks (e.g., ```python ... ```) if original text suggests code.
    - Use bold, italics, or inline code backticks where appropriate.

**Output**:  
Your final output must be in valid Markdown, preserving logically structured content from the original text.
You will be penalized if your response cuts off the end of original text without properly rewriting it.
"""

VALIDATE_REWRITE_PROMPT = """
## Objective
You are a sophisticated AI that detects generation errors in the response of another rewrite-assistant AI by outputting `true` (response valid) or `false` (respone invalid).

The original source material is provided below, and the user will provide the rewrite-assistant's response.

### Source Material
{user_message}

## Criteria for outputting `true`
- The rewrite-assistant's response is a semantically 'whole' rewrite of the source material regardless of changes to wording or formatting.

### Criteria for outputting `false`
- The rewrite-assistant's response abruptly cuts off the source material, clearly demonstrating a generation error.
